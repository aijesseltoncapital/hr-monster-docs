## Form Validation

The regulation management feature implements several validation rules to ensure data integrity:

1. **Required Fields**:
   - Country code and name for country configuration
   - Category code and name for tax categories
   - Plan code and name for benefit plans

2. **Code Format Validation**:
   - Country codes must follow ISO standards
   - Tax category codes must follow country-specific formats
   - Benefit plan codes must be unique within the system

3. **Numeric Validation**:
   - Tax rates must be valid percentages (0-100%)
   - Minimum wage must be a positive number
   - Standard work hours must be between 1-168 hours per week

Example validation implementation in form components:

```typescript
// Example validation in a form component
const validateTaxCategory = (values: TaxCategoryFormData) => {
  const errors: Partial<Record<keyof TaxCategoryFormData, string>> = {};
  
  if (!values.categoryCode) {
    errors.categoryCode = "Category code is required";
  }
  
  if (!values.categoryName) {
    errors.categoryName = "Category name is required";
  }
  
  if (values.calculationMethod === "percentage" && 
      (values.annualWageBase === null || values.annualWageBase <= 0)) {
    errors.annualWageBase = "Annual wage base must be greater than zero";
  }
  
  return errors;
};
```

## API Integration

### React Query Hooks

The regulation management feature uses React Query hooks for efficient data fetching and state management:

#### Country Management

```typescript
// Get all countries
export const useCountries = (params?: CountryFilters) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: [REGULATION_QUERY_KEY, 'countries', params],
    queryFn: () => regulationService.getCountries(params),
    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
  });
};

// Create a new country
export const useCreateCountry = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (payload: CountryFormData) => regulationService.createCountry(payload),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [REGULATION_QUERY_KEY, 'countries'] });
    },
  });
};
```

#### Tax Category Management

```typescript
// Get all tax categories
export const useTaxCategories = (params?: TaxCategoryFilters) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: [REGULATION_QUERY_KEY, 'tax-categories', params],
    queryFn: () => regulationService.getTaxCategories(params),
    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
  });
};

// Delete a tax category
export const useDeleteTaxCategory = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (id: string) => regulationService.deleteTaxCategory(id),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [REGULATION_QUERY_KEY, 'tax-categories'] });
    },
  });
};
```

### API Endpoints

The regulation management feature interacts with the following API endpoints:

```typescript
// Country Endpoints
const getCountries = async (params?: CountryFilters): Promise<Country[]> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get('/v1/regulation/countries', { params });
  return response.data;
};

const createCountry = async (payload: CountryFormData): Promise<Country> => {
  const response = await apiClient.post('/v1/regulation/countries', payload);
  return response.data;
};

// Tax Category Endpoints
const getTaxCategories = async (params?: TaxCategoryFilters): Promise<TaxCategory[]> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get('/v1/regulation/tax-categories', { params });
  return response.data;
};

const createTaxCategory = async (payload: TaxCategoryFormData): Promise<TaxCategory> => {
  const response = await apiClient.post('/v1/regulation/tax-categories', payload);
  return response.data;
};
```

## Integration with Other HR Monster Modules

The Regulation Management feature integrates with several other HR Monster modules:

1. **Payroll Processing**: Provides tax rates, deduction rules, and benefit calculations for payroll runs
2. **Employee Management**: Determines benefit eligibility and tax withholding based on employee attributes
3. **Time Off Management**: Supplies leave policies and accrual rules for time off requests
4. **Reporting**: Provides compliance data for regulatory reporting requirements

## Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep tax rates and regulatory information up to date, especially at the beginning of each tax year
2. **Documentation**: Maintain references to relevant laws and regulations for each configuration
3. **Testing**: Test payroll calculations with sample data after updating tax rates or deduction rules
4. **Versioning**: Track changes to regulatory settings over time for audit purposes
5. **Compliance Verification**: Regularly verify that configurations comply with current laws

### For Developers

1. **Modular Design**: Maintain separation between different regulation types for easier maintenance
2. **Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation for all regulation data
3. **Audit Trails**: Log all changes to regulatory settings with timestamps and user information
4. **Performance Optimization**: Cache frequently accessed regulation data
5. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Missing Tax Calculations**
   - Verify that the appropriate tax categories are configured
   - Check that tax brackets are set up with correct minimum and maximum amounts
   - Ensure the employee's tax jurisdiction is correctly assigned

2. **Incorrect Deduction Amounts**
   - Verify the calculation method for the deduction
   - Check if the deduction has minimum or maximum limits
   - Confirm that the employee meets eligibility requirements

3. **Benefit Plan Issues**
   - Verify that the benefit plan is active
   - Check that the employee meets the eligibility criteria
   - Confirm that the cost structure is correctly configured

4. **Time Off Accrual Problems**
   - Verify the accrual method and rate
   - Check if maximum balance limits are correctly set
   - Confirm that carry-over rules are properly configured

## Technical Implementation

The Regulation Management feature is implemented using:

1. **React Components**: For rendering the UI elements
2. **React Query**: For data fetching and state management
3. **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
4. **Shadcn UI**: For consistent UI components
5. **TanStack Table**: For data tables with sorting and filtering

Key implementation details include:

- **Tabbed Interface**: Uses the Tabs component from Shadcn UI to organize different regulation categories
- **Dialog Forms**: Implements form dialogs for creating and editing regulation entities
- **Data Tables**: Uses TanStack Table for displaying regulation data with sorting and filtering
- **Search and Filter**: Implements client-side filtering for quick access to specific regulations
- **Modular Architecture**: Separates each regulation type into its own module for maintainability

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the Regulation Management feature include:

1. **Bulk Import/Export**: Tools for importing and exporting regulation data in bulk
2. **Change History**: Tracking historical changes to regulations with effective dates
3. **Regulatory Updates**: Integration with external services for automatic regulatory updates
4. **Compliance Checking**: Automated validation of configurations against regulatory requirements
5. **Multi-Country Payroll**: Enhanced support for organizations operating in multiple countries
6. **Visualization Tools**: Graphical representation of tax brackets and other numerical data
7. **Approval Workflows**: Multi-step approval processes for regulation changes
